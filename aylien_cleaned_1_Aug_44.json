The Afghan security forces managed to kill one of the terrorists; the rest escaped.A senior official in the Indian security establishment said there was recognition in New Delhi that the terrorists probably attacked the gurdwara because it was a soft target. It wouldn\u2019t have been an easy target since the security had been beefed up and more troop firewalls deployed.Even while the grieving Afghan Sikhs were cremating the victims on Thursday afternoon, a bomb exploded nearby creating further scare in the area.Since the US announced a deal with the Taliban on February 29, there has been a spurt in violence in Afghanistan with resurgence of the Haqqani network and relocation of terror camps of both LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed from Pakistan.According to counter-terror analysts, the Haqqani network comprises mainly of Zardan tribe based in Nangarhar, Khost, Nuristan and Kunar provinces, which is in direct conflict with the miniscule Sikh community over land in Jalalabad and trade in Kabul.On July 1, 2019, the Haqqani network targeted the Sikh community in Jalalabad as they came to meet President Ashraf Ghani during his visit to Nangarhar province. With Taliban, Haqqani network, LeT and JeM all under control of the Pakistani deep state, Afghanistan again will provide strategic space to its terrorist arm for controlling Kabul and hitting at Kashmir.Already there are inputs from western agencies about JeM and LeT moving their training camps to eastern borders of Afghanistan with Kashmir in the crosshairs. The Taliban, with their sword arm Haqqani network, will handle Afghanistan while the Islamic State and Al Qaeda would be their digital fronts in the social media space.After the Gurudwara attack, the Indian security agencies fear that Indian consulates in Jalalabad and Kandahar will be targeted by the Haqqani network and associates in coming days.","heading":"In Kabul gurdwara attack, India was real target; Islamic State just a front: Intel","words_count":565,"hashtags":["#Afghanistan","#HaqqaniNetwork","#Gurdwara","#Jalalabad","#Taliban","#Kabul","#LashkareTaiba","#India","#IslamicStateOfIraqAndTheLevant","#Sikh","#Kandahar","#Pakistan","#NangarharProvince","#Intel","#DiplomaticMission","#FederalIntelligenceService","#GuruHarRai","#Delhi","#ListOfWarriorsCharacters","#Intelligence","#SirajuddinHaqqani","#AK47","#NewDelhi","#Consul","#Firewall","#Cremation","#JaisheMohammed","#Counterterrorism","#Khost","#NuristanProvince","#KunarProvince","#PresidentOfTheUnitedStates","#AshrafGhani","#Kashmir","#Reticle","#Sword","#AlQaeda","#DigitalTerrestrialTelevision","#SocialMedia","#Grappling","#Virus","#Jihad"],"keywords":["real","India","target","Islamic","attack","front","gurdwara","Kabul","Intel","Islamic State","Haqqani network","Indian security","Haqqani","network","Afghanistan","Indian","Taliban","Security","terrorists","Gurdwara","Jalalabad","Afghan","attackers","Sikh","provinces","Pakistani","deep","jihad","intelligence","Delhi","Sirajuddin Haqqani","grappling","Pakistan","consulate","cremating","LeT","Al Qaeda","Embassy","Gurudwara","firewalls","sword","social media","AK-47","crosshairs","Blackstar","western intelligence","Jaish-e-Mohammed","Nuristan","President","New Delhi","virus","Nangarhar","Nangarhar province","Ashraf Ghani","Khost","Kashmir","digital","Guru Har Rai","Kunar","Kandahar","counter-terror"],"publish_time":1585222499000,"body_polarity":"positive","body_polarity_score":0.862251,"title_polarity":"negative","title_polarity_score":0.467729,"country_origin":"IN","state_origin":"Delhi","city_origin":"Delhi"},{"summary":"Lucknow: BJP MLA from Ghaziabad, Nand Kishore Gurjar, has asked the state police to \"break their legs who violate the lockdown orders\".

Towards that end, Qureshi has also written to a dozen of IAS officers -- requesting arrangement of food items for about 300 people for the next month at least -- bureaucrats he happens to know because of his past interactions with them as a social worker.","heading":"Covid-19: Help him help these helpless migrants","words_count":824,"hashtags":["#Mumbai","#Lockdown","#Pandemic","#Uttarakhand","#Bihar","#UttarPradesh","#Coronavirus","#Huddle","#Riot","#Epicenter","#PrimeMinisterOfTheUnitedKingdom","#NarendraModi","#Malad","#India","#WorldWarII","#Prasanna","#Rediffcom","#Telephone","#Jharkhand","#Karnataka","#Chhattisgarh","#MeltingPot","#NongovernmentalOrganization","#Vegetable","#Venturing","#AutoRickshaw","#Coconut","#IAS","#IndianAdministrativeService","#SocialWork"],"keywords":["helpless","migrants","Covid-19","people","Qureshi","food items","families","Mumbai","lockdown","months","food","livelihoods","wagers","items","workers","huddle","Prasanna","autorickshaw","Narendra Damodardas Modi","social worker","Rediff.com","IAS","riot","Malad","vegetable","Karnataka","Uttarakhand","Jharkhand","India","Bihar","epicentre","Chhattisgarh","telephone","war","coconut","Prime Minister","pandemic","pandemics","melting pot","NGOs","Uttar Pradesh","coronavirus","venturing"],"publish_time":1585195391000,"body_polarity":"positive","body_polarity_score":0.974848,"title_polarity":"negative","title_polarity_score":0.989007,"country_origin":"IN","state_origin":null,"city_origin":null},{"summary":"Uttarakhand Education Secretary R Meenakshi Sundaram on Wednesday issued an order directing all government or private schools in the state to collect tuition fees from students after situation, created by the threat of the spread of COVID-19 global pandemic, normalises.In a letter addressed to the District Magistrates, Sundaram said: \u201cIt has come to the notice of the government that certain private schools are pressurising the parents of wards to submit the tuition fees immediately.
